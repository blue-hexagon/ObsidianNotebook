# Notes

This repository contains markdown notes on **DevOps**, **programming**, and more. Feel free to browse through the content.

## Obsidian.md

I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) as my markdown editor. You can clone this repository to access the Vault, a collection of notes.

### Features

Obsidian offers useful plugins like Git keybindings. For example, you can stage, commit, and push changes with keybindings such as: `Ctrl + F1` followed by `Ctrl + F2`.

Feel free to explore the notes.
