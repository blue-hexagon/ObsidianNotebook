Code should be open for extension but closed for modification. This rule shouldn't be taken to an extreme.
## Liskov Substitution Principle
Substitutability is a principle in object-oriented programming stating that, in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of the program.
## Interface Segregation Principle
Break out your interfaces into smaller interfaces or smaller classes, so that each class that implements the interface is able to implement the entire interface.
